# Pressure-day judge (#375)

Mode: development. Declaration `metadata/pressure_judge.json` sha256 `5822a5e34fe4…`. Scored days 2018-06-29 to 2025-12-31. Pass rule: tier 1 (onset warning) at lead >= 1, tier 3 (no crying wolf) at every lead, and tier 5 (week-ahead window), at +5 bp; 90% stationary bootstrap intervals.

## calendar_climatology (benchmark): FAIL at +5 bp

Tier 1 no, tier 3 no, tier 5 no. Scarce regime alone (state >= 2, reported only): fail (tier 1 no, tier 3 no, tier 5 no; 23 onsets).
